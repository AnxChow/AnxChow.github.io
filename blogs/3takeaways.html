        <hr>
        <p class="blog-date">July 14, 2020</p>
        <p class="blog-desc">Recently, I had the opportunity to talk to two Northwestern alumni, both of whom founded their own companies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubhgarimella/">Kaustubh Garimella</a>, of <a href="https://draftbuff.com/">DraftBuff</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@nihar_20515">Nihar Bobba</a>, of <a href="https://wizely.in/">Wizely</a>). Hearing about their experiences, I wanted to note down the key points that stuck with me and made me think. I’m publishing them here in case others find it interesting:</p>
        <h3>You don’t have to have an idea to be an entrepreneur</h3>
        <p>I used to be skeptical of the notion of “problem finding” for the sake of starting a company. My thinking was, if there is a problem worth solving, you or someone you know would have experienced it and you could go from there. <b>However, most great insights don’t come from passive observation.</b></p>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/@nihar_20515">Nihar Bobba</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://wizely.in/">Wizely</a>, told me about his process. He started out with one fact: he was interested in fin-tech. He then spent time observing macro trends, understanding policy, and finding gaps through that. Following this initial investigation, he relied on user insight to guide his solution building.</p>
        <p>A key takeaway from this discussion was that, at the start of the entrepreneurship process, it helps to have really, really strong product skills (see this <a href="https://blog.tryexponent.com/product-manager-skills-framework/">article</a> if you’re unsure what “product skills” are). This makes a lot of sense, given much of the insight development and prioritization of what to build for an MVP comes from user empathy and product intuition.</p>
        <h3>Knowing when you’ve found product/market fit is hard</h3>
        <p>I’d heard about “product/market fit” (PMF), but never thought of it in practice and how it might affect company direction decisions. If you experience 10x growth in a short amount of time, how do you know if that is just the tip of the iceberg for features to be built, or if you’ve hit the sweet spot and should scale, scale, scale to capitalize on the fit?</p>
        <p>So what is PMF? A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit#:~:text=Product%2Fmarket%20fit%2C%20also%20known,in%20its%20product(s)">wiki search</a> tells us it is the degree to which a product satisfies a market demand. The word “degree” tells us that <b>product/market fit is not binary</b>, rather a scale that entrepreneurs want to slide higher and higher on.</p>
        <p>An MVP that shows basic PMF might be enough to garner interest of early customers, and maybe investors — but to have a high level of success, companies should hope to achieve product/market fit to the point where adoption is growing faster than the company is able to scale (then all effort goes toward scaling up). According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubhgarimella/">Kaustubh Garimella</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://draftbuff.com/">DraftBuff</a>, knowing when you’ve hit the extreme PMF to capitalize on is a delicate art. Here, again, it helps to have strong product skills with deep product sense, intuition, and user empathy.</p>
        <h3>Stick to your values, it will pay off</h3>
        <p>As an entrepreneur, there will come times when you have multiple directions to choose from, with differing levels of monetization opportunity. Kaustubh’s advice here was to stick to your values, for two reasons:</p>
        <p>One is simply so you can look back and be proud of what you’ve built.</p>
        <p>Secondly, it could pay off in ways you didn’t expect. For example, DraftBuff initially had the opportunity to develop as a gambling platform. However, this wasn’t the vision Kaustubh had for his entrepreneurship experience, so they opted for a gameified social experience rather than one based on betting money. This decision, according to Kaustabh, opened up more partnership opportunities down the line, as many gaming companies are more on-board for a fun, light-hearted social experience as opposed to a gambling platform.</p>
        <p>If you follow your values, you’ll likely attract partners/clients/customers who share similar principles, and <b>they’ll appreciate you for it.</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>These were just some of the key points that stood out to me from my discussions with these two founders (they gave so many more). Being an entrepreneur understandably comes with many interesting, although difficult, challenges. There are many paths to start a company, but it’s clear that one thing aspiring entrepreneurs can do to prepare is to <a href="https://jackiebo.medium.com/five-exercises-to-practice-product-sense-57b9104ef8da">develop product sense</a>, product intuition, and a deep empathy for users — as these are much needed skills to build a successful company.</p>
        <p>Huge thanks to Kaustubh and Nihar for graciously giving me some of their time.</p>
